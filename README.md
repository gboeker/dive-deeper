# Dive Deeper 

## Overview

Dive Deeper is a web app that facilitates deeper connections amongst people. It is a card game, with each card having a different question to help the players engage in conversation. Users can register and login, and onced an account is created they can add their own questions, and create their own decks.

## Data Model

The application will store Users, CardDecks, and Questions
* users can have multiple card decks (via references?)
* each card deck contains multiple questions

An Example User:

```javascript
{
  username: "bagelthebeagle",
  hash: // a password hash,
  lists: // an array of references to List documents
}
```

An Example List with Embedded Items:

```javascript
{
  user: // a reference to a User object
  cardDeckName: "For Best Friends",
  items: [
    { question: "What's a compliment you've recieved recently? ", played: false},
    { question: "What was your highlight of the week?", played: true},
  ]
}
```
